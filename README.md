## Welcome to the Overleaf Research Workspace

This repository (overleaf-research-workspace) is your digital laboratory. It contains your data, analysis scripts (R/Python), and several GitHub Actions workflows.

It contains a submodule named overleaf-research-manuscript. That submodule is the only thing linked to Overleaf.
