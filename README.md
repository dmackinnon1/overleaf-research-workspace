# overleaf-research-workspace

## Welcome to the Overleaf Research Workspace.

This repository (overleaf-research-workspace) is your digital laboratory. It contains your data, analysis scripts (R/Python), and several GitHub Actions workflows.

It contains a submodule named overleaf-research-manuscript. That submodule is the only thing linked to Overleaf.

- Do you have Data/Scripts? Put them here in the Workspace.

- Do you have LaTeX text? Put it in the Manuscript submodule.

- This repository will also contain the latest PDF of the manuscript, accessibility reports and changelogs
